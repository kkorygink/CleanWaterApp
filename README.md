# CleanWaterApp
CS 2340 Projects ; NASA challenge - [IN PROGRESS]

This app is loosely based on the NASA challenge to map out drinking water resources. It was designed specifically with
the idea that many in developing countries could put the application to use by safely locating good sources of water that
is clean and safe to drink.

The link to the challenge can be found here:Â https://2015.spaceappschallenge.org/challenge/clean-water-mapping/

I am part of a 6 man group that is trying to create a variant of this application.
Group members: Dilip Shekhar, Ishbir Singh, Matthew Lemons, Zara Farooq, Maxwell Bronstein, Kirill Korygin
